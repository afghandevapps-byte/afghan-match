    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Photos & Privacy Controls</h2>
    <p>
      Afghan Match offers privacy-first controls. Photos can be hidden until a match occurs.
      Some example profiles may appear while the community grows; these are clearly marked and never message users.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Safety & Moderation</h2>
    <p>
      Users may block or report profiles at any time.
      Reports are reviewed to maintain community safety.
      Afghan Match provides tools and guidance, but users remain responsible for their own interactions.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Data is retained while your account is active. Upon account deletion, your data is permanently removed,
      except where retention is required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You may delete your account at any time from within the app.
      Deletion removes your profile, photos, and messages and signs you out immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy (18+ Only)</h2>
    <p>
      Afghan Match is intended for adults aged 18 and over. We do not knowingly collect data from minors.
      If we learn that an account belongs to a minor, we will take steps to restrict access and remove the account
      in accordance with applicable requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Access your data</li>
      <li>Update or correct information</li>
      <li>Delete your account</li>
      <li>Manage privacy and notification preferences</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here or within the app.

    <h2>Child Safety Standards</h2>
    <p class="small">
      Afghan Match is a Social/Dating category application intended for adults. We maintain child safety standards
      designed to prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) and to respond quickly to potential concerns.
    </p>

    <h3>1) Zero Tolerance for CSAE</h3>
    <p>
      We prohibit any content or behavior that sexualizes, exploits, endangers, or targets minors. This includes (but is not limited to)
      grooming behavior, predatory conduct, sexual content involving minors, and any attempt to facilitate exploitation.
      Accounts involved in such behavior may be suspended or permanently removed.
    </p>

    <h3>2) CSAM Prohibition and Response</h3>
    <p>
      Afghan Match does not permit Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). If CSAM is suspected or detected, we will
      remove the content where possible, restrict the account, and take appropriate action including reporting when
      required by applicable laws and regulations.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Reporting & User Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      Users can report profiles, messages, or behavior directly inside the app at any time (for example, from a profile menu or chat screen).
      Reports help us investigate and enforce safety rules, including child safety protections.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      If you are reporting an urgent child safety concern and cannot access the in-app reporting flow, email us using the dedicated contact below.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Enforcement & Review Process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We review reports and may request additional context when needed.</li>
      <li>We may restrict features (chat, discovery), hide profiles, suspend, or permanently ban accounts for violations.</li>
      <li>We cooperate with lawful requests and act to protect users and platform integrity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5) Child Safety Point of Contact</h3>
    <p>
      For child safety concerns (CSAE/CSAM), contact:<br/>
